# streamcast

icecast broadcasting ❄️

`streamcast` is an [Icecast](https://icecast.org) server that you can send audio to and have it broadcasted to multiple listeners.

To start the server `cd` into `src` and run:

```sh
./start.sh
```

The server will run on [`http://localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000).
However, you still need to mount a source first to listen to any music.
